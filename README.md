# Overview
subreddit Search is a Google Chrome extension designed to search specific keywords within subreddits. It serves as a shortcut to using the built-in reddit search.

Since I can't post the extension on the Chrome Web Store due to not having the 5 USD at the time of creation, I am just uploading it here instead.
# Installation
Drag and drop the subreddit_search.crx file into your Chrome window on the chrome://extensions page. You do not need to have Developer Mode enabled to install or use it.

Uninstallation is as simple as clicking on the trashcan icon and confirming your deletion.

# Syntax
The extension has an example query underneath the search bar:

> e.g. gaming Super Mario

Of course, you can replace these with any subreddit and query combination you desire.

The **FIRST** word will always represent the subreddit name, so make sure you type it exactly how it is written in the URL. Every word afterwards serves as your search keywords.
